At this moment, I’m exploring the tutorial by the Younes Lab YouTube channel, experimenting with the code and making adjustments along the way.
Monte Carlo π Approximation
A simple Python project to approximate the value of π using a Monte Carlo simulation. Random points are generated, and their distribution within a square and a circle is used to estimate π. Visualizations and interactive updates make it a great tool for learning and experimentation!
